'''
Python has two primitive loop commands
    while loop
    for loop
'''

i = 1
while i <= 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1

#using else keyword in while
    #With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

x = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
